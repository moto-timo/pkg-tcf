         ykush_url = "http://USER:PASSWORD@HOST/SOCKET",
         ykush_serial = "YKXXXXX")

    restart the server and it yields::

      $ tcf list
      local/arduino101-NN

    :param str name: name of the target

    :param str fs2_serial: USB serial number for the FlySwatter2 (defaults
      to *TARGETNAME-fs2*

    :param str serial_port: name of the serial port  (defaults to
      ``/dev/tty-TARGETNAME``)

    :param str ykush_serial: :ref:`USB serial number
      <ykush_serial_number>` of the YKUSH hub.

    :param str ykush_url: (optional) URL for the DLWPS7 power controller
      to the YKUSH. If *None*, the YKUSH is considered always on. See
      :py:func:`dlwps7_add`.

      FIXME: take a PC object so something different than a DLWPS7 can be
      used.

    **Overview**

    To power on the target, first we power the YKUSH, then the
    Flyswatter, then the serial port and then the board itself. And thus
    we need to wait for each part to correctly show up in the system
    after we power it up (or power off). Then the system starts OpenOCD
    to connect it (via the JTAG) to the board.

    Powering on/off the YKUSH is optional, but highly recommended.

    See the :ref:`rationale <arduino101_rationale>` for this complicated
    setup.

    **Bill of materials**

    - an available port on a DLWPS7 power switch (optional)

    - a Yepkit YKUSH power-switching hub (see bill of materials in
      :py:func:`ykush_targets_add`

    - an Arduino101 (note it must have original firmware; if you need
      to reset it, follow :ref:`these instructions
      <a101_fw_upgrade>`).

    - a USB A-Male to B-female for power to the Arduino 101

    - a USB-to-TTL serial cable for the console (power)

    - three M/M jumper cables

    - A Flyswatter2 for flashing and debugging

    3. Flash a new serial number on the Flyswatter2 following the
       :ref:`instructions <fs2_serial_update>`.

    - a USB A-Male to B-female for connecting the Flyswatter to the YKush
      (power and data)

    - An ARM-JTAG 20-10 adapter miniboard and flat ribbon cable
      (https://www.olimex.com/Products/ARM/JTAG/ARM-JTAG-20-10/) to
      connect the JTAG to the Arduino101's jtag port.

    **Connecting the test target fixture**

    1. connect the Arduino's USB port to the YKUSH downstream port 3

    2. Flyswatter2 JTAG:

      a. connect the USB port to the YKUSH downstream port 1

      b. flash a new serial number on the Flyswatter2 following the
         :ref:`instructions <fs2_serial_update>`.

         This is needed to distinguish multiple Flyswatter2 JTAGs
         connected in the same system, as they all come flashed with
         the same number (*FS20000*).

      c. connect the ARM-JTAG 20-10 adapter cable to the FlySwatter2 and
         to the Arduino101.

         Note the flat ribbon cable has to be properly aligned; the
         red cable indicates pin #1. The board connectors might have a
         dot, a number *1* or some sort of marking indicating where
         pin #1 is.

         If your ribbon cable has no red cable, just choose one end as
         one and align it on both boards to be pin #1.

    3. connect the USB-to-TTY serial adapter to the YKUSH downstream
       port 2

    4. connect the USB-to-TTY serial adapter to the Arduino 101 with the
       M/M jumper cables:

       - USB FTDI Black (ground) to Arduino101's serial ground pin
       - USB FTDI White (RX) to the Arduino101' TX
       - USB FTDI Green (TX) to Arduino101's RX.
       - USB FTDI Red (power) is left open, it has 5V.

    5. connect the YKUSH to the server system and to power as
       described in :py:func:`ykush_targets_add`

    **Configuring the system for the fixture**

    1. Choose a name for the target: *arduino101-NN* (where NN is a
       number)

    2. Find the YKUSH's serial number *YKNNNNN* [plug it and run *dmesg*
       for a quick find], see :py:func:`ykush_targets_add`.

    3. Configure *udev* to add a name for the serial device that
       represents the USB-to-TTY dongle connected to the target so we can
       easily find it at ``/dev/tty-TARGETNAME``. Different options for
       USB-to-TTY dongles :ref:`with <usb_tty_serial>` or :ref:`without
       <usb_tty_sibling>` a USB serial number.

    :param str serial_port: (optional) name of the serial port
      (defaults to ``/dev/tty-NAME``)


    **Overview**

    The Arduino 101 is powered via the USB connector. The Arduino 101
    does not export a serial port over the USB connector--applications
    loaded onto it might create a USB serial port, but this is not
    necessarily so all the time.

    Thus, for ease of use this fixture connects an optional external
    USB-to-TTY dongle to the TX/RX/GND lines of the Arduino 101 that
    allows a reliable serial console to be present.

    When the serial dongle is in use, the power rail needs to first
    power up the serial dongle and then the board.

    Per this :ref:`rationale <arduino101_rationale>`, current leakage and
    full power down needs necesitate of this setup to cut all power to
    all cables connected to the board (power and serial).

    This fixture uses :class:`ttbl.tt.tt_dfu` to implement the target;
    refer to it for implementation details.


    **Bill of materials**

    - two available ports on an YKUSH power switching hub (serial
      *YKNNNNN*); only one if the serial console will not be used.
    - an Arduino 101 board
    - a USB A-Male to micro-B male cable (for board power)
    - (optional) a USB-to-TTY serial port dongle
    - (optional) three M/M jumper cables

    **Connecting the test target fixture**

    1. (if not yet connected), connect the YKUSH to the server system
       and to power as described in :py:func:`ykush_targets_add`

    2. connect the Arduino 101's USB port to the YKUSH downstream port
       *PORTNUMBER*

    3. (if a serial console will be connected) connect the USB-to-TTY
       serial adapter to the YKUSH downstream port *PORTNUMBER2*

    3. (if a serial console will be connected) connect the USB-to-TTY
       serial adapter to the Arduino 101 with the M/M jumper cables:

       - USB FTDI Black (ground) to Arduino 101's serial ground pin
         (fourth pin from the bottom)
       - USB FTDI White (RX) to the Arduino 101's TX.
       - USB FTDI Green (TX) to Arduino 101's RX.
       - USB FTDI Red (power) is left open, it has 5V.

    **Configuring the system for the fixture**

    1. Choose a name for the target: *a101-NN* (where NN is a number)

    2. (if needed) Find the YKUSH's serial number *YKNNNNN* [plug it and
       run *dmesg* for a quick find], see :py:func:`ykush_targets_add`.

    3. Find the board's :ref:`serial number <find_usb_info>`.

       Note these boards, when freshly plugged in, will only stay in
       DFU mode for *five seconds* and then boot Zephyr (or whichever
       OS they have), so the USB device will dissapear. You need to
       run the lsusb or whichever command you are using quick (or
       monitor the kernel output with *dmesg -w*).

    4. Configure *udev* to add a name for the serial device that
       represents the USB-to-TTY dongle connected to the target so we can
       easily find it at ``/dev/tty-a101-NN``. Different options for

    **Overview**

    The Quark D2000 board comes with a builtin JTAG / Flyswatter, whose
    port can be programmed. The serial port is externally provided via a
    USB-to-TTY dongle.

    However, because of this, to power the test target up the power rail
    needs to first power up the serial dongle and then the board. There
    is a delay until the internal JTAG device we can access it, thus we
    need a delay before the system starts OpenOCD to connect it (via the
    JTAG) to the board.

    Per this :ref:`rationale <arduino101_rationale>`, current leakage and
    full power down needs necesitate of this setup to cut all power to
    all cables connected to the board (power and serial).

    **Bill of materials**

    - two available ports on an YKUSH power switching hub (serial *YKNNNNN*)
    - a Quark D2000 reference board
    - a USB A-Male to micro-B male cable (for board power)
    - a USB-to-TTY serial port dongle
    - three M/M jumper cables

    **Connecting the test target fixture**

    1. connect the Quark D2000's USB-ATP port with the USB A-male to
       B-micro to YKUSH downstream port *N1* for powering the board

    2. connect the USB-to-TTY serial adapter to the YKUSH downstream
       port *N2*

    3. connect the USB-to-TTY serial adapter to the Quark D2000 with the
       M/M jumper cables:

       - USB FTDI Black (ground) to board's serial ground pin
       - USB FTDI White (RX) to the board's serial TX ping
       - USB FTDI Green (TX) to board's serial RX pin
       - USB FTDI Red (power) is left open, it has 5V.

    4. connect the YKUSH to the server system and to power as
       described in :py:func:`ykush_targets_add`

    **Configuring the system for the fixture**

    1. Choose a name for the target: *mv-NN* (where NN is a number)

    2. (if needed) Find the YKUSH's serial number *YKNNNNN* [plug it and
       run *dmesg* for a quick find], see :py:func:`ykush_targets_add`.

    3. Flash a new serial number on the Flyswatter2 following the
       :ref:`instructions <fs2_serial_update>`.

    4. Configure *udev* to add a name for the serial device that
       represents the USB-to-TTY dongle connected to the target so we can
       easily find it at ``/dev/tty-TARGETNAME``. Different options for
       USB-to-TTY dongles :ref:`with <usb_tty_serial>` or :ref:`without
       <usb_tty_sibling>` a USB serial number.

    6. Ensure the board is flashed with the Quark D2000 ROM (as
       described :ref:`here <fw_update_d2000>`).

        upload mode (with a different USB serial number) from which the
        only way to get them out is by power-cycling it.

        So the power rail for this thing is set with a Power Controller
        object that does the power cycle itself (pc_board) and then
        another that looks for a USB device with the right serial number
        (serial_number). If it fails to find it, it executes an action
        and waits for it to show up. The action is power cycling the USB
        device with the pc_board power controller. Lastly, in the power
        rail, we have the glue that opens the serial ports to the device
        and the flasher object that start/stops OpenOCD.

    **Overview**

    **Bill of materials**

    - a DLWPS7 unit and power cable connected to power plug

    - a network cable

    - a connection to a network switch to which the server is also
      connected (*nsN*)

    **Connecting the power switch**

    1. Ensure you have configured an class C *192.168.X.0/24*,
       configured with static IP addresses, to which maybe only this
       server has access to connect IP-controlled power
       switches.

       Follow :ref:`these instructions <internal_network>` to create a
       network.

       You might need a new Ethernet adaptor to connect to said
       network (might be PCI, USB, etc).

    2. connect the power switch to said network

    3. assign a name to the power switch and add it along its IP
       address in ``/etc/hosts``; convention is to call them *spY*,
       where X is a number and *sp* stands for *Switch; Power*.

       .. warning:: if your system uses proxies, you need to add *spY*
          also to the *no_proxy* environment varible in
          :file:`/etc/bashrc` to avoid the daemon trying to access the
          power switch through the proxy, which will not work.

    4. with the names ``/etc/hosts``, refer to the switches by name
       rather than by IP address.

    **Configuring the system**

    1. Choose a name for the power switch (*spM*), where *M* is a number

    2. The power switch starts with IP address *192.168.0.100*; it needs
       to be changed to *192.168.X.M*:

       a. Connect to *nsN*

       b. Ensure the server access to *192.168.0.100* by adding this
          routing hack::

            # ifconfig nsN:2 192.168.0.0/24

       c. With lynx or a web browser, from the server, access the
          switch's web control interface::

          $ lynx http://192.168.0.100

       d. Enter the default user *admin*, password *1234*, select *ok*
          and indicate *A* to always accept cookies

          .. warning: keep the default user and password at
                      *admin*/*1234*, the default configuration relies
                      on it. It makes no sense to change it anyway as
                      you will have to write them down in the
                      configuration. Limitations of HTTP Basic Auth

       e. Hit enter to refresh link redirecting to
          *192.168.0.100/index.htm*, scroll down to *Setup* and page down
          to *IP address*.

       f. Lookup setup of IP address, change to *192.168.N.M* (where *x*
          matches *spM*), gateway *192.168.N.1*; hit the *submit* next to
          it.

       g. remove the routing hack::

            # ifconfig nsN:2 down

       e. Extra steps needed for newer units
          (https://dlidirect.com/products/new-pro-switch)

          The new refreshed unit looks the same, but has wifi
          connectivity and pleny of new features, some of which need
          tweaking; login to the setup page again and for each of
          this, set the value/s and hit *submit* before going to the
          next one:

          - Disable the security lockout

            *Delay> Wrong password lockout* set to zero minutes

          - Turn on setting power after power loss:

            *Power Loss Recovery Mode > When recovering after power
            loss* select *Turn all outlets on*

          - Access setings (quite important, as this allows the driver
            to access the same way for the previous generation of the
            product too):

            ENABLE: *allow legacy plaintext login methods*

            Note in (3) below it is explained why this is not a
            security problem in this kind of deployments.

    3. The unit's default admin username and password are kept per
       original (admin, 1234):

       - They are deployed in a dedicated network switch that is internal
         to the server; none has access but the server users (targets run
         on another switch).

       - they use HTTP Basic Auth, they might as well not use
         authentication

    4. Add an entry in ``/etc/hosts`` for *spM* so we can refer to the
       DLWPS7 by name instead of IP address::

         192.168.4.X	spM

    """Fake power controller to implement networks using macvtap
    for virtual machines and bridges for physical devices.

    This behaves as a power control implementation that when turned:

    - on: starts an internal network a `macvtap
      http://virt.kernelnewbies.org/MacVTap` Linux device that allows
      virtual machines to talk to each other and to the outside. When
      a physical device is also present, it is used as the upper
      device (instead of a bridge) so traffic can flow from physical
      targets to the virtual machines in the network.

    - off: stops all the network devices, making communication impossible.

    This also supports capturing network traffic with *tcpdump*, which
    can be enabled setting the target's property *tcpdump*::

      $ tcf property-set TARGETNAME tcpdump FILENAME

    this will have the target dump all traffic capture to a file
    called *FILENAME* in the daemon file storage area for the user who
    owns the target. The file can then be recovered with::

      $ tcf broker-file-download FILENAME

    *FILENAME* must be a valid file name, with no directory
    components. Note this requires the property *tcpdump* being listed
    in :data:`ttbl.test_target.user_properties`, which is added after
    this class declaration.

    Example configuration:

    >>> ttbl.config.target_add(
    >>>     ttbl.tt.tt_power("nw01", vlan_pci()),
    >>>     tags = {
    >>>         'ipv6_addr': 'fc00::1:1',
    >>>         'ipv4_addr': '192.168.1.1',
    >>>         'ipv4_prefix_len': 24,
    >>>         'mac_addr': '02:01:01:00:00:24:',
    >>>     })
    >>> ttbl.config.targets['nw01'].tags.['interfaces'].append('interconnect_c')

    Now QEMU targets (for example), can declare they are part of this
    network and upon start, create a tap interface for themselves::

      $ ip link add link _bnw01 name tnw01TARGET type macvtap mode bridge
      $ ip link set tnw01TARGET address 02:01:00:00:00:IC_INDEX up

    which then is given to QEMU as an open file descriptor::

      -net nic,model=virtio,macaddr=02:01:00:00:00:IC_INDEX
      -net tap,fd=FD

   (:py:class:`Linux <tt_qemu_linux>` and
   :py:class:`Zephyr <tt_qemu_zephyr>` VMs already
   implement this behaviour).

    Notes:

    - keep target names short, as they will be used to generate
      network interface names and those are limited in size (usually to
      about 12 chars?), eg tnw01TARGET comes from *nw01* being the
      name of the network target/interconnect, TARGET being the target
      connected to said interconnect.

    - IC_INDEX: is the index of the TARGET in the interconnect/network;
      it is recommended, for simplicty to make them match with the mac
      address, IP address and target name, so for example:

      - targetname: pc-04
      - ic_index: 04
      - ipv4_addr: 192.168.1.4
      - ipv6_addr: fc00::1:4
      - mac_addr: 02:01:00:00:00:04

    If a tag named *mac_addr* is given, containing the MAC address
    of a physical interface in the system, then it will be taken over
    as the point of connection to external targets. Connectivity from
    any virtual machine in this network will be extended to said
    network interface, effectively connecting the physical and virtual
    targets.

    .. warning:: DISABLE Network Manager's (or any other network
                 manager) control of this interface, otherwise it will
                 interfere with it and network will not operate.

                 Follow :ref:`these steps <howto_nm_disable_control>`

    System setup:

    - *ttbd* must be ran with CAP_NET_ADMIN so it can create network
       interfaces. For that, either add to systemd's
       ``/etc/systemd/system/ttbd@.service``::

         CapabilityBoundingSet = CAP_NET_ADMIN
         AmbientCapabilities = CAP_NET_ADMIN

      or as root, give ttbd the capability::

        # setcap cap_net_admin+pie /usr/bin/ttbd

    - *udev*'s */etc/udev/rules.d/ttbd-vlan*::

        SUBSYSTEM == "macvtap", ACTION == "add", DEVNAME == "/dev/tap*", \
            GROUP = "ttbd", MODE = "0660"

      This is needed so the tap devices can be accessed by user
      *ttbd*, which is the user that runs the daemon.

      Remember to reload *udev*'s configuration with `udevadm control
      --reload-rules`.

      This is already taken care by the RPM installation.

    **Fixture setup**

    - Select a network interface to use (it can be a USB or PCI
      interface); find out it's MAC address with *ip link show*.

    - add the tag *mac_addr* with said address to the tags of the
      target object that represents the network to which which said
      interface is to be connected; for example, for a network called
      *nwc*

      .. code-block:: python

         ttbl.config.target_add(
             ttbl.tt.tt_power('nwc', vlan_pci()),
             tags = dict(
                 mac_addr = "a0:ce:c8:00:18:73",
                 ipv6_addr = 'fc00::13:1',
                 ipv6_prefix_len = 112,
                 ipv4_addr = '192.168.13.1',
                 ipv4_prefix_len = 24,
             )
         )
         ttbl.config.targets['NAME'].tags['interfaces'].append('interconnect_c')

      or for an existing network (such as the configuration's default
      *nwa*):

      .. code-block:: python

         # eth dongle mac 00:e0:4c:36:40:b8 is assigned to NWA
         ttbl.config.targets['nwa'].tags_update(dict(mac_addr = '00:e0:4c:36:40:b8'))

      Furthermore, default networks *nwa*, *nwb* and *nwc* are defined
      to have a power control rail (versus an individual power
      controller), so it is possible to add another power controller
      to, for example, power on or off a network switch:

      .. code-block:: python

         ttbl.config.targets['nwa'].pc_impl.append(
             ttbl.pc.dlwps7("http://USER:PASSWORD@sp5/8"))

      This creates a power controller to switch on or off plug #8 on
      a Digital Loggers Web Power Switch named *sp5* and makes it part
      of the *nwa* power control rail. Thus, when powered on, it will
      bring the network up up and also turn on the network switch.

    - lastly, for each target connected to that network, update it's
      tags to indicate it:

      .. code-block:: python

         ttbl.config.targets['TARGETNAME-NN'].tags_update(
             {
               'ipv4_addr': "192.168.10.30",
               'ipv4_prefix_len': 24,
               'ipv6_addr': "fc00::10:30",
               'ipv4_prefix_len': 112,
             },
             ic = 'nwc')

    By convention, the server is .1, the QEMU Linux virtual machines
    are set from .2 to .10 and the QEMU Zephyr virtual machines from
    .30 to .45. Physical targets are set to start at 100.

    Note the networks for targets and infrastructure :ref:`have to be
    kept separated <separated_networks>`.

class tt_qemu_linux(ttbl.tt_qemu.tt_qemu):
    """QEMU x86-64 test target that can run Linux cloud images
    (Fedora, Clear and other) with serial port control.

    Supports power control, serial console and image flashing
    interfaces, as well as networking in between images and to the
    upstream host's network.

    Note that the disk assigned to this images is transient,
    implemented in a couple of ways:

    - if a QCOW image is given, a copy-on-write disk is created when
      the machine powers up and then discarded when it powers off. The
      original image is never modified. A property (*persist*) can be
      set to non-false to allow keeping the transient disk.

    - if an ISO image is given, it is considered to be a LIVE image
      and a transient disk with serial number TCF-home is created,
      that can be used to write to.

      TCF provides a Fedora Kickstarter configuration to generate
      images that are used for testing:

      - remove root's password

      - autologin the console to a root shell

      - configure the IP address (if networking is setup)

      - enable SSH access to the root account with no password


    Add to your configuration file ``/etc/ttbd-production/conf_10_targets.py``:

    .. code-block:: python

       ttbl.config.target_add(
           tt_qemu_linux("qlNAME",
                         dict(
                             ram_megs = 1024,
                             qemu_ro_image = '/var/lib/ttbd/tcf-live.iso',
                             qemu_bios_image = '/usr/share/qemu/bios.bin',
                         )),
           target_type = "qemu-linux-TYPE-x86_64",
           tags = dict(more tags...)
       )

    Where:
     - ``qemu_ro_image``: file path of the virtual disk image to use
       as base (see below for configuring the image)
       Note this has to be given mandatorily to the tt_qemu_linux
       constructor, cannot be added after the fact
     - ``qemu_image_size``: Size in gigs (eg: 10G) of the virtual disk
       image size; when the virtual disk image is created referring to
       the base, it will be made to be this size.
     - ``qemu_bios_image``: path the BIOS file to use; depending on
       the image, one or another will be needed.
     - ``ram_megs``: Megabytes of RAM to use; for bigger Linux
       distros, you want to start with 1024.
     - ``TYPE``: *fedora*, *clear*, ...
     - ``NAME``: name for the virtual machine; it is recommend to
       begin with *ql* (QEMU Linux) and a letter matching the type
       (eg: *qlf03* for QEMU Linux Fedora #3).

    Restart the server and it yields::

      $ tcf list
      local/qlNAME

    **Bill of materials**

    - QEMU installed in the server (``dnf install -y qemu``)

    - (optional) Fedora 25 cloud image deployed to the server's
      ``/var/lib/ttbd`` or any location specified in *ro_image*.

    **Setting up for the fixture**

    Note that due to the size of the images, it is not possible to
    upload them to the server's repository using *tcf images*. They
    have to be uploaded to the server via other methods and then the
    images can be configured.

    To create the ``tcf-live.iso`` image:

    - use a Fedora system, with access to any repositories you will
      require RPMs from (setup proxies, etc)

    - create a work directory *MYWORKDIR*::

        $ mkdir -p MYWORKDIR
        $ cd $MYWORKDIR

    - if any specific RPM packages are needed, create files
      *tcf-live-ANYNAME.pkgs* in *MYWORKDIR*::

        $ echo RPM1 > tcf-live-01-list.pkgs
        $ echo RPM2 > tcf-live-04-list.pkgs

      one RPM per line, multiple lines per file, see
      :download:`/usr/share/tcf/live/tcf-live-02-core.pkgs
      <../ttbd/live/tcf-live-02-core.pkgs>` for examples.

    - if any extra kickstarter configuration is needed, add in
      *tcf-live-extra-*.ks* files

    - invoke */usr/share/tcf/live/mk-liveimg.sh*, for which you need
      *sudo* rights::

        $ /usr/share/tcf/live/mk-liveimg.sh .
        ...
        frags = 20
        Setting supported flag to 0

      note this creates a cache in *MYWORDIR/tcf-live/cache* with
      downloaded RPMs and others; if you re-run again from within the
      same workdir, the cache will be reused.

    - Move the image to its default location on /var/lib/ttbd::

        $ mv tcf-live/tcf-live.iso /var/lib/ttbd/

      obviously, other names and locations can be used, as long as
      they are then configured when invoking :class:`tt_qemu_linux`
      with the *qemu_ro_image* variable

    **Configuring the system for the fixture**

    Once the image file ``tcf-live.iso`` has been setup and
    distributed to the server, add to each server's
    ``conf_10_targets.py`` configuration files with:

    .. code-block:: python

       ttbl.config.target_add(
           tt_qemu_linux("qlfNN",
                         tags = dict(
                             ram_megs = 1024,
                             qemu_ro_image = '/var/lib/ttbd/tcf-live.iso',
                             qemu_bios_image = '/usr/share/qemu/bios.bin',
                         )),
           target_type = "qemu-linux-fedora-x86_64",
           tags = dict(
               ... more tags as neeed
           )
       )

    Note the default location for images is ``/var/lib/ttbd``, but it
    can be anywhere the daemon has access to.

    **Network configuration**

    Network is supported in various ways:

    - NAT is currently broken!!!

      To have the VM connect to the host's upstream network via NAT,
      connect it to the interconnect *nat_host* (last lines) by adding
      a tag *nat_host* set to *True*:

      >>> ttbl.config.target_add(
      >>>     ...
      >>>     tags = dict(
      >>>         ...
      >>>         nat_host = True,
      >>>         ...
      >>>     ))

      Alternatively, once created:

      >>> ttbl.config.targets['qlfNAME'].add_to_interconnect('nat_host', {})

      The *nat_host* interconnect, albeit doesn't really exist, makes
      teh *tt_qemu_linux* class create a network interface that will
      be configured to NAT on the upstream connection of the host.

      .. warning:: this will get you potentially to the open Internet
         or whatever is available from the host.

    - Connecting to *ttbd* internal test networks is accomplished by
      using QEMU and *macvtap* to a *TTBD interconnect* as
      :class:`vlan_pci` added to any target that supports power
      switching.

      >>> ttbl.config.targets['qlfNN'].add_to_interconnect(
      >>>     'nwXX',
      >>>     dict(ipv4_addr = "192.168.XX.NN",
      >>>          ipv4_prefix_len = 24,
      >>>          ipv6_addr = "fc00::X:NN",
      >>>          ipv6_prefix_len = 112,
      >>>          mac_addr = "02:XX:00:00:00:%NN",
      >>>     ))

      For that, the target's tags need to define in their
      interconnects dictionary an entry named after the interconnect's
      name with (eg: to add *qlfNAMEXX* to interconnect *XX*, append
      after the target definition):

      >>> ttbl.config.targets['qlNAMEXX'].tags_update(
      >>>     dict(
      >>>        ipv4_addr = "192.168.XX.NN",
      >>>        ipv4_addr_len = 24,
      >>>        ipv6_addr = "fc00::XX:NN",
      >>>        ipv4_addr_len = 112,
      >>>        mac_addr = "02:XX:00:00:00:NN",
      >>>     ),
      >>>     ic = "XX")

      - Network number (*XX*) -- try have your networks named in a way
        that calls for easy numbering numbered (eg: a -> 10, b -> 11,
        c -> 12...)  so those numbers can be used to assign IP
        addresses (eg: for letter A, number 10 (0x0A), IPv4 prefix can
        be 192.168.X.Y and MAC address prefix can be 02:0A:00:00:00:YY

      - *mac_addr*: is the MAC address to give the target; note it has
        to be different for all targets (so if we use proper network and
        target indexes, they shall all end up being different).

    **Troubleshooting notes**

    - If *cloud-init* seems not to be working, make sure
      ``/var/lib/cloud/sem/user-scripts*`` in the image is removed

    power-switching hub for power, serial console and JTAG.

    Add to a server configuration file:

    :param str ykush_serial: :ref:`USB serial number
      <ykush_serial_number>` of the YKUSH hub where it is connected to
      for power control.

    :param int ykush_port_board: number of the YKUSH downstream port
      where the board power is connected.

    :param str target_type: the target type "sam_e70_xplained"
      or "sam_v71_xplained"

    **Overview**

    Per this :ref:`rationale <arduino101_rationale>`, current leakage and
    full power down needs necesitate of this setup to cut all power to
    all cables connected to the board (power and serial).

    **Bill of materials**

    - a SAM E70 or V71 xplained board
    - a USB A-Male to micro-B male cable (for board power, JTAG and console)
    - one available port on an YKUSH power switching hub (serial *YKNNNNN*)

    **Connecting the test target fixture**

    1. Ensure the SAM E70 is properly setup:

       Using Atmel's *SAM-BA* In-system programmer, change the boot
       sequence and reset the board in case there is a bad image;
       this utility can be also used to recover the board in case
       it gets stuck.

       A. Download from `Atmel's website
          <http://www.atmel.com/tools/atmelsam-bain-systemprogrammer.aspx>`_
          (registration needed) and install.

          .. note:: This is **not** open source software

       B. Close the erase jumper *erase* (in SAMEv70 that's J200 and
          in SAMEv71 it is J202; in both cases, it is located above the
          CPU when you rotate the board so you can read the CPU's
          labeling in a normal orientation).

       C. Connect the USB cable to the taget's *target USB* port (the
          one next to the Ethernet connector) and to a USB port that
          is known to be powered on.

          Ensure power is on by verifying the orange led lights on on
          the Ethernet RJ-45 connector.

       D. Wait 10 seconds

       E. Open the erase jumper J202 to stop erasing

       F. Open *SAM-BA* 2.16

          Note on Fedora 25 you need to run *sam-ba_64* from the
          SAM-BA package.

       G. Select which serial port is that of the SAM e70 connected to
          the system. Use *lsusb.py -ciu* to locate the *tty/ttyACM*
          device assigned to your board::

    2. connect the SAM E70/V71's *Debug USB* port with the USB
       A-male to B-micro to YKUSH downstream port *N*

    3. connect the YKUSH to the server system and to power as
       described in :py:func:`ykush_targets_add`

    **Configuring the system for the fixture**

    1. Choose a name for the target: *sam-e70-NN* (where NN is a number)

    2. (if needed) Find the YKUSH's serial number *YKNNNNN* [plug it and
       run *dmesg* for a quick find], see :py:func:`ykush_targets_add`.

    3. Find the board's :ref:`serial number <find_usb_info>`

    4. Configure *udev* to add a name for the serial device for the
       board's serial console so it can be easily found at
       ``/dev/tty-TARGETNAME``. Follow :ref:`these instructions
       <usb_tty_serial>` using the board's *serial number*.

    The tinyTILE is a miniaturization of the Arduino/Genuino 101 (see
    https://www.zephyrproject.org/doc/boards/x86/tinytile/doc/board.html).

    The fixture used by this configuration uses a YKUSH hub for power
    switching, no debug/JTAG interface and allows for an
    optional external serial port using an USB-to-TTY serial adapter.

    Add to a server configuration file:

    .. code-block:: python

       tinytile_add("ti-NN", "SERIALNUMBER", "YKNNNNN", PORTNUMBER,
                    [ykush_port_serial = N2,]

       downstream port where the board's serial port is connected.

    :param str serial_port: (optional) name of the serial port
      (defaults to ``/dev/tty-NAME``)


    **Overview**

    The tinyTILE is powered via the USB connector. The tinyTILE does
    not export a serial port over the USB connector--applications
    loaded onto it might create a USB serial port, but this is not
    necessarily so all the time.

    Thus, for ease of use this fixture connects an optional external
    USB-to-TTY dongle to the TX/RX/GND lines of the tinyTILE that
    allows a reliable serial console to be present. To allow for
    proper MCU board reset, this serial port has to be also power
    switched on the same YKUSH hub (to avoid ground derivations).

    For the serial console output to be usableq, the Zephyr Apps
    configuration has to be altered to change the console to said
    UART. The client side needs to be aware of that (via
    configuration, for example, to the Zephyr App Builder).

    When the serial dongle is in use, the power rail needs to first
    power up the serial dongle and then the board.

    Per this :ref:`rationale <arduino101_rationale>`, current leakage and
    full power down needs necesitate of this setup to cut all power to
    all cables connected to the board (power and serial).

    This fixture uses :class:`ttbl.tt.tt_dfu` to implement the target;
    refer to it for implementation details.

    **Bill of materials**

    - two available ports on an YKUSH power switching hub (serial
      *YKNNNNN*); only one if the serial console will not be used.
    - a tinyTILE board
    - a USB A-Male to micro-B male cable (for board power)
    - a USB-to-TTY serial port dongle
    - three M/M jumper cables

    **Connecting the test target fixture**

    1. (if not yet connected), connect the YKUSH to the server system
       and to power as described in :py:func:`ykush_targets_add`

    2. connect the Tiny Tile's USB port to the YKUSH downstream port
       N1

    3. (if a serial console will be connected) connect the USB-to-TTY
       serial adapter to the YKUSH downstream port N2

    3. (if a serial console will be connected) connect the USB-to-TTY
       serial adapter to the Tiny Tile with the M/M jumper cables:

       - USB FTDI Black (ground) to Tiny Tile's serial ground pin
         (fourth pin from the bottom)
       - USB FTDI White (RX) to the Tiny Tile's TX.
       - USB FTDI Green (TX) to Tiny Tile's RX.
       - USB FTDI Red (power) is left open, it has 5V.

    **Configuring the system for the fixture**

    1. Choose a name for the target: *ti-NN* (where NN is a number)

    2. (if needed) Find the YKUSH's serial number *YKNNNNN* [plug it and
       run *dmesg* for a quick find], see :py:func:`ykush_targets_add`.

    3. Find the board's :ref:`serial number <find_usb_info>`.

       Note these boards, when freshly plugged in, will only stay in
       DFU mode for *five seconds* and then boot Zephyr (or whichever
       OS they have), so the USB device will dissapear. You need to
       run the lsusb or whichever command you are using quick (or
       monitor the kernel output with *dmesg -w*).

    4. Configure *udev* to add a name for the serial device that
       represents the USB-to-TTY dongle connected to the target so we can
       easily find it at ``/dev/tty-TARGETNAME``. Different options for
       USB-to-TTY dongles :ref:`with <usb_tty_serial>` or :ref:`without
       <usb_tty_sibling>` a USB serial number.

    **Overview**

    The Minnowboard provides a serial port which is used to control
    the BIOS (when needed) and to access the OS. Any AC power controller
    can be used to power on/off the Minnowboard's power brick.

    The target type implemented here can only boot ELF kernels and is
    implemented using the :class:`grub2 loader <ttbl.tt.grub2elf>`. In
    summary, a USB drive is used as a boot drive that is multiplexed
    using a USBRLY8b relay bank from the Minnowboard to the
    server:

     - when the Minnowboard is off, the USB drive is connected to the
       server, so it can be setup / partitioned / formatted / flashed

     - when Minnowboard is on, the USB drive is connected to it.

    **Bill of materials**

    - A Minnowboard and its power brick

    - An open socket on an AC power switch, like the :class:`Digital
      Logger Web Power Switch 7 <ttbl.pc.dlwps7>`

    - A USB serial cable terminated with 6 way header (eg:
      https://www.amazon.com/Converter-Terminated-Galileo-BeagleBone-Minnowboard/dp/B06ZYPLFNB)
      preferibly with a serial number (easier to configure)

    - a USB drive (any size will do)

    - four relays on a USBRLY08b USB relay bank
      (https://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/htm/usb_rly08btech.htm)
      [either 1, 2, 3 and 4 or 5, 6, 7 and 8]

    - One USB Type A female to male cable, one USB Type A male cable

    - Two USB ports into the server

    **Connecting the test target fixture**

    1. connect the Minnowboard's power trick to the socket in the AC
       power switch and to the board DC input

    2. connect the USB serial cable to the Minnowboard's TTY
       connection and to the server

    3. Cut and the USB-A male-to-female cable and separate the four
       lines on each end; likewise, cut and separate the four lines on
       the other USB-A male cable; follow the detailed instructions in
       :class:`ttbl.usbrly08b.plugger` where:

       - Ensure the USBRLY8B is properly connected and setup as per
         :class:`ttbl.usbrly08b.rly08b`

       - *DUT* is the USB-A female where we'll connect the USB drive,
         plug the USB drive to it. Label as *minnowboard-NN boot*

       - *Host A1/ON/NO* is the USB-A male connector we'll connect to
         the Minnowboard's USB 2.0 port -- label as
         *minnowboard-NN ON* and plug to the board

       - *Host A2/OFF/NC* is the USB-A make connector we'll connect to
         the server's USB port -- label as *minnowboard-NN OFF* and
         plug to the server.

       Note tinning the cables for better contact will reduce the
       chance of the USB device misbehaving.

       It is critical to get this part right; the cable connected to
       the NC terminals has to be what is connected to the server when
       the target is *off*.

       It is recommended to test this thoroughly in a separate system
       first.

    4. Ensure the Minnowboard MAX is flashed with *64 bit* firmware,
       otherwise it will fail to boot.

       To update it, connect it to a solid power (so TCF doesn't power
       it off in the middle), download the images from
       https://firmware.intel.com/projects/minnowboard-max (0.97 as of
       writing this) and follow the instructions.

    **Configuring the system for the fixture**

    1. Choose a name for the target: *minnowboard-NNx* (see :ref:`naming
       best practices <bp_naming_targets>`).

    2. Find the serial number of the USB drive, blank it to ensure it
       is properly initialized; example, in this case being
       */dev/sdb*::

         $ lsblk -nro NAME,TRAN,SERIAL | grep USB-DRIVE-SERIAL
         sdb usb USB-DRIVE-SERIAL
         $ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb

    3. Find the serial number of the USBRLY8b and determine the relay
       bank to use; bank 0 for relays 1, 2, 3 and bank 1 for relays 4
       or 5, 6, 7 and 8.

    4. Configure *udev* to add a name for the serial device for the
       board's serial console so it can be easily found at
       ``/dev/tty-TARGETNAME``. Follow :ref:`these instructions
       <usb_tty_serial>` using the serial dongle's *serial number*; e.g.::

         SUBSYSTEM == "tty", ENV{ID_SERIAL_SHORT} == "AC0054PT", \\
           SYMLINK += "tty-minnowboard-NN"

    5. Connect the Minnowboard to a display [vs the serial port, to
       make it easier] and with a keyboard, plug the USB drive
       directly and boot into the BIOS.

       a. Enter into the *Boot Options Manager*, ensure *EFI USB
          Device* is enabled; otherwise, add the option.

          Depending on the BIOS revision, the save/commit mechanism
          might be tricky to get right, so double check it by
          rebooting and entering the BIOS again to verify that *EFI
          booting from USB* is enabled.

       b. In the same *Boot Options Manager*, change the boot order to
          consider the *EFI booting from USB* option to be the first
          thing booted.

          Note that the EFI Bios tends to reset the boot drive order
          if at some point it fails to detect it, so a boot coercer
          like :class:`minnowboard_EFI_boot_grub_pc` is needed. This
          will workaound the issue.


    FIXME:
     - FIXME: need to have it re-plug the dongle if the server
       doesn't see it

    Troubleshooting:

     - UEFI keeps printing::

         map: Cannot find required map name.

       Make sure:

        - the USB relay plugger is properly connected and the drive is
          re-directed to the target when powered on, to the server
          when off

        - the drive is not DOS formatted, it needs a GPT
          partition table. Wipe it hard and re-deploy (eg: running tcf
          run) so it will be re-flashed from the ground up::

            # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/DEVICENODE bs=$((1024 * 1024)) count=100

        - Minnowboard is picky and some drives are faulty for it, even
          if they work ok in any other machine; replace the drive?

    - UEFI will do nothing when *BOOTX64* is executed::

        Shell> fs0:\EFI\BOOT\bootx64
        Shell>

      Double check the Minnowboard is flashed with a 64 bit firmware;
      see above in **Connecting the test target fixture**.
