# This is a generic systemd unit to run system-wide TTBD
#
# - run as root: systemctl enable ttbd@[tag].service
#
# Note it is set to user ttbd, so you will likely have permission
# issues. For your system's deployment, you will want to copy this to
# another name and set the ttbd user to the user who can access the
# resources it will need.
#
# Requirements:
# - Python package sdnotify (pip install sdnotify)
#

Description = Test Targer Broker Daemon %I
# We need network to be online (require) but want to start after it is
# done starting
Requires = network-online.target
After = network-online.target
# Say there is a daemon that controls the infrastructure
#Requires = ttbd@infrastructure.service

[Service]
# Run ExcecStartPre as root
PermissionsStartOnly = True
# Some needed tools might configure themselves in /etc/environment
# (-: do not fail if file does not exist)
EnvironmentFile = -/etc/environment

# The daemon needs the following capabilities enabled for its
# operation:
#
# - CAP_NET_ADMIN: to be able to setup network interfaces
#
# For other configurations that can be enabled but haven't been yet
# completely developed, you might need:
#
#  - CAP_NET_RAW: for DHCPd and tcpdump
#  - CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE: to start dhcpd/tftpd (port < 1024)
#  - CAP_SYS_CHROOT: for tftpd to work
AmbientCapabilities = CAP_NET_RAW CAP_NET_ADMIN

# Allow stuff started by this daemon to access the following
# capabilities (but the daemon doesn't need them/use them):
#
# - CAP_SETUID & CAP_SETGID: to be able to run sudo/suid,sgid from
#   inside us
#
# - CAP_SETGID: will need for tftpd to be able to work
#
# - CAP_SYS_ADMIN, so sudo-launched helpers can do stuff, but the
#   daemon itself doesn't need them. Things like re-reading partition
#   tables, etc
#
# - CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE & CAP_FOWNER: access files of other users once we
#   sudo
#
# - CAP_AUDIT_WRITE: so sudo can send audit messages and not die trying
#
