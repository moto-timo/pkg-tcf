   BSP

     A board support package supported by a :term:`test target`

   BSP model

     A combination of BSPs on which a :term:`test target` works.

     For example, the Arduino 101 `x86` and `arc` BSPs that can work
     independently or together, the following BSP models would be
     supported: `x86`, `arc` and `x86+arc`.

   test case

     A test case is a flow to evaluate a single requirement, feature
     or functionality.

     A test case can be a program or a script

   test target

     Something that can be used to run a test case; this can be a
     group of actual HW units, not just a single one. It can be a
     computer, a light switch or a toaster.

     Each test target has a name, a type and it might support zero or
     more BSPs (think for example, a board that has an x86 and an ARC
     processor, like the Arduino 101); as well it has a list of tags
     and values that describe its capabilities.

   target controller

     A piece of software that understands how to talk to a target

   test target broker

     A service/machine to which one or more :term:`test target`\s are
     connected. It offers an abstracted API to manipulate and operate
     them; the API is implemented via target-specific :term:`target
     controller`\s.

   target broker

     See :term:`test target broker`.

   target driver

     Same as :term:`target controller`

   test finder

     A piece of software that locates test cases by looking at tag
     strings that define them as such.

   test case finder

     Same as :term:`test finder`

   test runner

     Linux machine that can drive the running and execution of test
     cases or command a target hardware to execute test cases.

   test case driver

     this is the entity that runs on the :term:`test runner`
     that understands how different test cases can be run.

     eg: knows how to launch a *@static* test case

     eg: knows how to interpret the output of a cetain type of test
     cases to decide what it is

   ttbd

     See :term:`test target broker`

   run ID

     An identification tag for a particular run of a sequence of test
     cases in a set of targets
